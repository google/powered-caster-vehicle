This code is an implementation of kinematic and dynamic calculations and control
for a Holomni powered caster vehicle. The work here is based on research
conducted at the Stanford CS Robotics Lab using the XR400 robot developed at
Nomadic Technologies, Inc. In 2013, Holomni, LLC. was purchased by Google LLC.
